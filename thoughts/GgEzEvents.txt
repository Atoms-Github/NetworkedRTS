Order is:

1. Wait for new frame.
2. Call key/mouse event handlers.
3. Call update. Call render. Right after each other.
5. Repeat.


Issues:
Sometimes lags. Shouldn't.
Reasonably large ping on mouse moving.




We can't do that!
Its going to be jumping around!
We can't use two different timers.

If we base everything off the render one, and just use the other one as a recommendation for how far to sim, its not gonna work. If we get unlucky, we'll fall on one side, otherwise the other side.
One launch in a thousand, say, will be 1 frame lag.
